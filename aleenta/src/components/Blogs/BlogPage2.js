                        So, my friend, watch yourself when you 
                        plan to take that leap toward success with your goals. 
                        See the futility of your mind which brings that fear quotient to a 
                        level where you give up on that goal or that dream. When you do give up, 
                        one fine day, you look back and see that the goals and dreams seem so 
                        ancient that it feels like a past-life memory. You only have regrets of not trying. 
                        Become aware of all of that which is 
                        controlling your actions, decisions and that which questions your free will.
